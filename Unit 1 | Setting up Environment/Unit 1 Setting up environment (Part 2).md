# Unit 2:   Setting up our development environment (Part 2)

**- Summary -**
 
This unit is a general idea about web development.
We'll setup the development environment for the rest of the course. 

After setting up the environment, we will introduce a **CSS** framework for better web page creationg: **Bootstrap**.

## Topic 2.3 Basic setup of Vue.js framework  <a name="paragraph3"></a>




**What did we do there?**

Basically, the values from our **Vue object**, from the **main.js** file, are going to fill the places **{{ menu_title }}** and **{{ main_title }}**. 



## Topic 2.4 Practice! <a name="paragraph4"></a>

Let's practice a bit more using VUE to change the content on the web page.

Change the two paragraphs we have (**<p>**) and make their content come from the javascript file, like we did for the subtitles.
