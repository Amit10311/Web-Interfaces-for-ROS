# Unit 3:   Move the Robot! Publishing to a topic!

**- Summary -**
 
In this unit, we'll **connect to ROSBridge**, as we have seen in the introduction, but now by creating our own code. 

* You will see step-by-step **how to configure your JavaScript code** to connect from a **Vue.js** application. 

* After that, we will publish to a **ROS topic** in order to move the robot in the simulation.

Step 1 : Environment preparation 
</b></p>
 

Let's prepare the environment for this **Unit 03**, create a new folder for it..

First, make sure you have **stopped the webserver** we started in the previous chapter. 

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7000 
```
and press `Ctrl + c`


Create a new folder: **webpage_ws/unit_03**. Enter the folder and execute the web server from there.

```
$ mkdir ~/webpage_ws/unit_03
$ cd ~/webpage_ws/unit_03
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 7000 ...
```

Copy the **index.html** file from the previous unit to this new folder:

```
cp ~/webpage_ws/unit_02/* ~/webpage_ws/unit_03/
```
